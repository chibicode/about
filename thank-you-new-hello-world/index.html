I picked a <a href="http://justanotherfoundry.com/facit">neat typeface</a> and crafted modest visuals, just as I always do.</p>

<p>But this time, I tried something new: I abandoned <em>lorem ipsum</em> while designing. Although <a href="http://littleipsum.com/">LittleIpsum.app</a> simplified my workflow, I wanted better filler text. In the end, I resorted to the words from the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different">Think Different</a>&rdquo; commercial. I configured my text editor to <em>act different</em>, literally; every time I type &ldquo;lorem&rdquo;, it inserts &ldquo;<em>Here’s to the crazy ones &hellip; the ones who do.</em>&rdquo; Far more inspiring.</p>

<p>Can I apply the same logic for my first post? Last week, some of my friends shared their shiny new blog on their Facebook. Most wrote a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; article, which said nothing more than, &ldquo;Hello 2013.&rdquo; Shouldn&#39;t there be a template that&#39;s more inspiring?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an idea: write a &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; note. Pick a person you met after your last blogging attempt had failed. Then show how much you appreciate him/her. Simple and sincere, yet rarely done. Let me give it a shot.</p>

<h2>Thank you, Elle</h2>

<p><img alt="Elle" src="http://chibicode.com/images/elle.jpg" /></p>

<p>I want to thank my girlfriend <a href="http://ellekasai.com/">Elle</a>. Thank you for staying with me, even though we&#39;re more than 5000 miles apart.</p>

<p>Good friends <em>show</em> me how to become a better person. Great friends <em>make</em> me a better person. After I met Elle, I leveled up in so many ways. For one, I learned to encourage others, instead of criticizing.</p>

<h2>Encourage others, instead of criticizing</h2>

<p>Elle does sales at a tech company in Tokyo. She aspires to make living by expressing her sense of beauty and creativity. On her free time, she sings, she dances, and she <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8yN_TuVOpc">models</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Elle got hooked to user experience (UX) design. She didn&#39;t know any programming, photoshop or psychology, but I knew she had talent. As an engineer-turned-designer, I believe that anyone can learn UX design. However, two traits separate the best from the rest: <em>empathy for others</em>, and <em>obsession for ordering disorder</em>. She had both.</p>

<p>First, Elle is, for lack of a better word, the nicest person I&#39;ve met. For many people, the upper bound of your empathy is the one toward your family. I know a lot of young women who really care about their family. But Elle really, <em>really</em> cares about her family. So much so that, her father, mother, and sister come up in our conversation more often than not. And of course, she&#39;s incredibly empathetic to her friends and coworkers.</p>

<p>Second, Elle&#39;s obsessed about ordering disorder, especially her own room. When she&#39;s not working, reading, or sleeping, she&#39;s rearranging her room. Even when we skype. I used to do the same in my teens—one time I destroyed my $200 study desk as I moved it around too frequently. Eight years later, when I was pushing pixels at work, I got the same feeling—ordering disorder, like rearranging my room. I&#39;m confident that Elle will find passion in design as I did.</p>

<p>So I asked her to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/dribbble">@dribbble</a> and perform small design tasks, like creating a powerpoint template.</p>

<p>However, as I helped, I struggled to <em>encourage</em> her. I criticized too often. When she needed guidance on information architecture, I provided <em>solutions</em> instead of asking <em>questions</em>. I told her to learn faster, even though years ago, I learned much slower than she did. Oh how arrogant I was.</p>

<p>Elle was patient. She swallowed my criticism. She came up with <em>much</em> better information architecture than what I suggested. Evidently I wasn&#39;t any help, yet she still thanked me. She did great. I was ashamed.</p>

<p><em>Don&#39;t criticize. Encourage instead</em>.</p>

<p>Few months later, I&#39;m still far from being perfect, but I became more hearty in my appreviation and lavish in my praise, as Dale Carnegie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034">would say</a>. It&#39;s all because of Elle&#39;s natural talent and humble personality. I can&#39;t thank her enough. We hope to design beautiful UX together in the near future. </p>

<p>Although I have so much more to stay, I&#39;ll stop before it gets too embarrassing. In summary, I suggest using a &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; note format to kickstart your blog.</p>

<p>I set a bar to write at least 40 articles by the year-end. 1 down, 39 more to go.</p>
