<h2>Professional</h2>

<p>I love to study hard problems, even though I&#39;m not exactly the best at solving them. As a startup guy, I&#39;m interested in: software architecture, product design, and growth strategies.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken some baby steps in mastering these areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a CS degree from Carnegie Mellon University. I worked at Palantir Technologies as a software engineer upon graduation. I attended <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> and <a href="http://sapporo.rubykaigi.org/2012/en/">RubyKaigi</a> in 2012.</li>
<li>I have a HCI masters degree, also from Carnegie Mellon University. After Palantir, I worked at Quora as a product designer.</li>
<li>As a designer at Quora, I focused on user growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2013, I&#39;ll strive to become a specialist in each of the above fields. I challenge myself to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Release and maintain a Ruby library—probably some API wrapper—and make my empty <a href="https://github.com/chibicode">Github</a> profile more exciting.</li>
<li>Teach design to more people.</li>
<li>Grow EdSurge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>I take introversion to a whole new level. I&#39;m probably the quietest persons you&#39;ve ever known. I prefer communicating online. I also cannot drink.</p>

<p>On a brighter note, I love to teach and help people succeed. I even won the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scsfacts/uesugi.html">best undergrad TA award</a>. This is why I&#39;m passionate about education reform, both in the U.S. and Japan.</p>

<p>I no longer have any hobbies, but in high school, I used to play guitar and was a varsity cross country runner. I&#39;m currently in search for a tennis coach.</p>

<p>I was also born with a weird birthmark (Nevus of Ota), which can be cured by surgery.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>In the first quarter century of my life, I learned the following three lessons:</p>

<p>First, family is the most important piece of your life. My logo illustrates my immediate family: my mother is the left block, my father is the bottom block, my brother is the bottom right block, and I&#39;m the top right block. The logo also reads as &ldquo;S&rdquo; (my first initial), &ldquo;U&rdquo; (my last initial), and 上 (the first Japanese character of my last name).</p>

<p>Second, while entrepreneurs must find problems and disrupt the status quo, they also must appreciate things around them—even broken things. Be grateful for someone else&#39;s work before you come up with an improvement. Show gratitude to people in your comfort zone before you say bye to them.</p>

<p>Third, for each field you consider to be your speciality, define what it means to you. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Coding is about changes.</em> Change the code now to make it easier to change in the future.</li>
<li><em>Design is about decisions.</em> Decide on a set of hidden rules—rules that users will never notice.</li>
<li><em>Teaching is a series of two step processes.</em> Let&#39;s say you want to teach X to someone. First, make X seem easy and worth mastering. Second, have your student do X from start to finish on their own. There&#39;s nothing more.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Places</h2>

<p>My favorite cities in the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac,_Maryland">Potomac, Maryland</a> is the only place I call home. I lived here when I first moved to the U.S. (2000-2006). Probably one of the best places on earth to raise a kid.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.)">Georgetown, Washington D.C.</a> will always be my favorite shopping place. Beautiful waterfront views of the Potomac River.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a> is where I lived in college. I know the city inside out. My favorite neighborhoods were Squirrel Hill, East Liberty, and Mount Washington.</li>
</ul>

<p>My favorite cities in Japan:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama">Yokohama, Kanagawa</a> is where I lived during my elementary school years, and also during the spring/summer of 2012. Not much night life, but still a lot going on. Also very close to Chigasaki, my favorite beachtown.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya,_Tokyo">Shibuya, Tokyo</a> is my default hang-out place in Tokyo. Shibuya and its neighboring cities Roppongi and Ebisu house most of the recent startups in japan.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabe">Tanabe, Wakayama</a> is a rural town where my grandparents live. Lots of childhood memories.</li>
</ul>
