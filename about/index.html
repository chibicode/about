I code in Ruby, design in Web Inspector, and write in English and Japanese. 
I work at <a href="http://edsurge.com">EdSurge</a> in San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>I was born in Osaka, Japan on January 26, 1988 to Masako Uesugi and Kazuya Uesugi and have a younger brother, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsaku_Uesugi">Shinsaku Uesugi</a>.</p>

<h2>Professional</h2>

<p>I love studying hard problems, even though I&#39;m not exactly the best at solving them. Currently, I&#39;m interested in the following hard problems in the startup world: (1) software architecture, (2) product design, and (3) growth strategies. I&#39;ve taken some baby steps in mastering these areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>I obtained a CS degree from Carnegie Mellon University; I worked at Palantir Technologies as a software engineer upon graduation.</li>
<li>I obtained a HCI masters degree, also from Carnegie Mellon University. After Palantir, I worked at Quora as a product designer.</li>
<li>When I was a designer at Quora, I focused on user growth. At EdSurge, I also focus on user growth from an engineering point of view.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2013, I&#39;ll strive to become a specialist in each of the above fields. I challenge myself to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Release and maintain a Ruby library - probably an API wrapper of some sort - and make my empty <a href="https://github.com/chibicode">Github</a> profile more exciting.</li>
<li>Teach product design to a friend of mine who aspires to become a designer. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scsfacts/uesugi.html">I learned in college</a> that teaching is the best way to learn.</li>
<li>Grow EdSurge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>I take introversion to a whole new level; it&#39;s likely that I&#39;m one of the quietest persons you&#39;ve ever known. Online messaging is usually my preferred method of communication.</p>

<p>On a brighter note, I love to teach and help people succeed. That&#39;s why I&#39;m passionate about education reform, both in the U.S. and Japan.</p>

<p>I was also born with a weird birthmark (Nevus of Ota), which is supposedly curable by surgery.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>In the first quarter century of my life, I learned that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your family is the single most important thing in your life. My logo, which can be read as &ldquo;S&rdquo; (my first initial), &ldquo;U&rdquo; (my last initial), and ä¸Š (the first Japanese character of my last name), also illustrates my immediate family: my mother is the left block, my father is the bottom block, my brother is the bottom right block, and I&quot;m the top right block.</li>
<li>Be humble, honest, and helpful. The best book on this subject is written by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034">Dale Carnegie</a>.</li>
<li>You must not settle in your comfort zone. I did a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyF9UJvHmg">TEDx talk</a> on this topic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Places</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t have any favorite hobbies, but I can name my favorite cities. They&#39;re mostly the places I&#39;ve lived in. In the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac,_Maryland">Potomac, Maryland</a> is the only place I call home. I lived here when I first moved to the U.S. (2000-2006). Probably one of the best places on earth to raise a kid.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.)">Georgetown, Washington D.C.</a> will always be my favorite hang-out/shopping place. Beautiful waterfront views of the Potomac River.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a> is where I lived in college. I think I know the city inside out. My favorite neighborhoods were Squirrel Hill, East Liberty, and Mount Washington.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California">Cupertino, California</a> is the first Silicon Valley city I lived in, when I interned at Apple. I miss the days I biked around the town.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California">Menlo Park, California</a> is my current base. I love the downtown.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Japan:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama">Yokohama, Kanagawa</a> is where I lived during my elementary school years, and also during the Spring/Summer of 2012. Not much night life, but still a beautiful city with a lot going on. Also very close to Chigasaki, my favorite beachtown, and Tamachi, my favorite residential area in Tokyo.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya,_Tokyo">Shibuya, Tokyo</a> - my default go-out place. Startup scenes are also emerging in Shibuya and its neighboring cities Roppongi and Ebisu.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabe">Tanabe, Wakayama</a> is where my grandparents live. My best childhood memories are kept in this old town.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chita,_Aichi">Chita, Aichi</a> is my favorite beachtown in Central Japan. The food is delicious. Also close to my favorite airport (NGO).</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto">Kyoto City, Kyoto</a> is where I dream of living. Kyoto is the old capital of Japan and an incredibly popular place for travelers.</li>
</ul>
