I was born in Osaka, Japan on January 26, 1988 to Masako Uesugi and Kazuya Uesugi and have a younger brother, [Shinsaku Uesugi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsaku_Uesugi).

## Professional

I love to study hard problems, even though I'm not exactly the best at solving them. As a startup guy, I'm interested in: software architecture, product design, and growth strategies.

I've taken some baby steps in mastering these areas:

* I have a CS degree from Carnegie Mellon University. I worked at Palantir Technologies as a software engineer upon graduation. I attended [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/) and [RubyKaigi](http://sapporo.rubykaigi.org/2012/en/) in 2012.
* I have a HCI masters degree, also from Carnegie Mellon University. After Palantir, I worked at Quora as a product designer.
* As a designer at Quora, I focused on user growth.

In 2013, I'll strive to become a specialist in each of the above fields. I challenge myself to:

* Release and maintain a Ruby library—probably some API wrapper—and make my empty [Github](https://github.com/chibicode) profile more exciting.
* Teach design to more people.
* Grow EdSurge.

## Personal

I take introversion to a whole new level. I'm probably the quietest persons you've ever known. I prefer communicating online. I also cannot drink.

On a brighter note, I love to teach and help people succeed. I even won the [best undergrad TA award](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scsfacts/uesugi.html). This is why I'm passionate about education reform, both in the U.S. and Japan.

I no longer have any hobbies, but in high school, I used to play guitar and was a varsity cross country runner. I'm currently in search for a tennis coach.

I was also born with a weird birthmark (Nevus of Ota), which can be cured by surgery.

## Philosophy

In the first quarter century of my life, I learned the following three lessons:

First, family is the most important piece of your life. My logo illustrates my immediate family: my mother is the left block, my father is the bottom block, my brother is the bottom right block, and I'm the top right block. The logo also reads as "S" (my first initial), "U" (my last initial), and 上 (the first Japanese character of my last name).

Second, while entrepreneurs must find problems and disrupt the status quo, they also must appreciate things around them—even broken things. Be grateful for someone else's work before you come up with an improvement. Show gratitude to people in your comfort zone before you say bye to them.

Third, for each field you consider to be your speciality, define what it means to you. For example,

* *Coding is about changes.* Change the code now to make it easier to change in the future.
* *Design is about decisions.* Decide on a set of hidden rules—rules that users will never notice.
* *Teaching is a series of two step processes.* Let's say you want to teach X to someone. First, make X seem easy and worth mastering. Second, have your student do X from start to finish on their own. There's nothing more.

## Places

My favorite cities in the U.S.:

* [Potomac, Maryland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac,_Maryland) is the only place I call home. I lived here when I first moved to the U.S. (2000-2006). Probably one of the best places on earth to raise a kid.
* [Georgetown, Washington D.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.\)) will always be my favorite shopping place. Beautiful waterfront views of the Potomac River.
* [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh) is where I lived in college. I know the city inside out. My favorite neighborhoods were Squirrel Hill, East Liberty, and Mount Washington.

My favorite cities in Japan:

* [Yokohama, Kanagawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama) is where I lived during my elementary school years, and also during the spring/summer of 2012. Not much night life, but still a lot going on. Also very close to Chigasaki, my favorite beachtown.
* [Shibuya, Tokyo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya,_Tokyo) is my default hang-out place in Tokyo. Shibuya and its neighboring cities Roppongi and Ebisu house most of the recent startups in japan.
* [Tanabe, Wakayama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabe) is a rural town where my grandparents live. Lots of childhood memories.
