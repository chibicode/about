title: Thank You is The New Hello World

Within the first week of 2013, I resurrected my domain and rebooted my blog. I picked a [neat typeface](http://justanotherfoundry.com/facit) and crafted modest visuals, just as I always do.

But this time, I tried something new: I abandoned *lorem ipsum* while designing. Although [LittleIpsum.app](http://littleipsum.com/) simplified my workflow, I wanted better filler text. In the end, I resorted to the words from the "[Think Different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different)" commercial. I configured my text editor to *act different*, literally; every time I type "lorem", it inserts "*Here’s to the crazy ones ... the ones who do.*" Far more inspiring.

Can I apply the same logic for my first post? Last week, some of my friends shared their shiny new blog on their Facebook. Most wrote a "Hello World" article, which said nothing more than, "Hello 2013." Shouldn't there be a template that's more inspiring?

Here's an idea: write a "Thank You" note. Pick a person you met after your last blogging attempt had failed. Then show how much you appreciate him/her. Simple and sincere, yet rarely done. Let me give it a shot.

## Thank you, Elle

I want to thank my girlfriend [Elle](http://ellekasai.com/). Thank you for staying with me, even though we're more than 5000 miles apart.

Good friends *show* me how to become a better person. Great friends *make* me a better person. After I met Elle, I leveled up in so many ways. For one, I learned to encourage others, instead of criticizing.

## Encourage others, instead of criticizing

Elle is a sales rep at a tech company in Tokyo, but dreams of making a living by expressing her sense of beauty and creativity. On her free time, she sings, she dances, and she [models](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8yN_TuVOpc).

Recently, Elle got hooked to user experience (UX) design. She didn't know any programming, photoshop or psychology, but I knew she had talent. As an engineer-turned-designer, I believe that anyone can learn UX design, yet two traits separate the best from the rest: *empathy for others*, and *obsession for ordering disorder*. She had both.

First, Elle is, for lack of a better word, the nicest person I've met. You can tell by observing how she interacts with her father, mother, and sister because for most people, the upper bound of your kindness is the one toward your family. I think Elle cares about her family more than anybody else I've ever met. So much so that, her father, mother, and sister come up in our conversation more often than not. And of course, she's incredibly empathetic to her friends and coworkers. She posses a skill to see things from other person's point of view, a must-have asset for any UX designers.

Second, Elle's obsessed about ordering disorder, especially her own room. When she's not working, reading, or sleeping, she's rearranging her room. Even when we skype. I used to do the same in my teens—one time I destroyed my $200 study desk as I moved it around too frequently. Eight years later, when I was pushing pixels at work, I got the same feeling—ordering disorder, like rearranging my room. I'm confident that Elle will find passion in design as I did.

So I began coaching. I asked her to follow [@dribbble](http://twitter.com/dribbble) and perform small design tasks, like creating a powerpoint template.

However, as I helped, I struggled to *encourage* her. I criticized too often. When she needed guidance on information architecture, I provided *solutions* instead of asking *questions*. I told her to learn faster, even though years ago, I learned much slower than she did. Oh how arrogant I was.

Elle was patient. She swallowed my criticism. She came up with *much* better information architecture than what I suggested. Evidently I wasn't any help, yet she still thanked me. She did great. I was ashamed.

*Don't criticize. Encourage instead*.

Few months later, I'm still far from being perfect, but I became more hearty in my appreviation and lavish in my praise, as Dale Carnegie [would say](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034). It's all because of Elle's natural talent and humble personality. I can't thank her enough and look forward to working together in the near future.

Although I have so much more to say, I'll stop before it gets too embarrassing. In summary, I suggest using a "Thank You" note format to kickstart your blog.
