    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Within the first week of 2013, I resurrected my domain and rebooted my blog. I picked a &lt;a href="http://justanotherfoundry.com/facit"&gt;neat typeface&lt;/a&gt; and crafted modest visuals, just as I always do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, I tried something new: I abandoned &lt;em&gt;lorem ipsum&lt;/em&gt; while designing. Although &lt;a href="http://littleipsum.com/"&gt;LittleIpsum.app&lt;/a&gt; simplified my workflow, I wanted better filler text. In the end, I resorted to the words from the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different"&gt;Think Different&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; commercial. I configured my text editor to &lt;em&gt;act different&lt;/em&gt;, literally; every time I type &amp;ldquo;lorem&amp;rdquo;, it inserts &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Here’s to the crazy ones &amp;hellip; the ones who do.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; Far more inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I apply the same logic for my first post? Last week, some of my friends shared their shiny new blog on their Facebook. Most wrote a &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; article, which said nothing more than, &amp;ldquo;Hello 2013.&amp;rdquo; Shouldn&amp;#39;t there be a template that&amp;#39;s more inspiring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an idea: write a &amp;ldquo;Thank You&amp;rdquo; note. Pick a person you met after your last blogging attempt had failed. Then show how much you appreciate him/her. Simple and sincere, yet rarely done. Let me give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thank you, Elle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Elle" src="http://chibicode.com/images/elle.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank my girlfriend &lt;a href="http://ellekasai.com/"&gt;Elle&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you for staying with me, even though we&amp;#39;re more than 5000 miles apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good friends &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; me how to become a better person. Great friends &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; me a better person. After I met Elle, I leveled up in so many ways. For one, I learned to encourage others, instead of criticizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Encourage others, instead of criticizing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elle does sales at a tech company in Tokyo. She aspires to make living by expressing her sense of beauty and creativity. On her free time, she sings, she dances, and she &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8yN_TuVOpc"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Elle got hooked to user experience (UX) design. She didn&amp;#39;t know any programming, photoshop or psychology, but I knew she had talent. As an engineer-turned-designer, I believe that anyone can learn UX design. However, two traits separate the best from the rest: &lt;em&gt;empathy for others&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;obsession for ordering disorder&lt;/em&gt;. She had both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Elle is, for lack of a better word, the nicest person I&amp;#39;ve met. For many people, the upper bound of your empathy is the one toward your family. I know a lot of young women who really care about their family. But Elle really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cares about her family. So much so that, her father, mother, and sister come up in our conversation more often than not. And of course, she&amp;#39;s incredibly empathetic to her friends and coworkers. She&amp;#39;s an expert in seeing things from other person&amp;#39;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Elle&amp;#39;s obsessed about ordering disorder, especially her own room. When she&amp;#39;s not working, reading, or sleeping, she&amp;#39;s rearranging her room. Even when we skype. I used to do the same in my teens—one time I destroyed my $200 study desk as I moved it around too frequently. Eight years later, when I was pushing pixels at work, I got the same feeling—ordering disorder, like rearranging my room. I&amp;#39;m confident that Elle will find passion in design as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I asked her to follow &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/dribbble"&gt;@dribbble&lt;/a&gt; and perform small design tasks, like creating a powerpoint template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I helped, I struggled to &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt; her. I criticized too often. When she needed guidance on information architecture, I provided &lt;em&gt;solutions&lt;/em&gt; instead of asking &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt;. I told her to learn faster, even though years ago, I learned much slower than she did. Oh how arrogant I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elle was patient. She swallowed my criticism. She came up with &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better information architecture than what I suggested. Evidently I wasn&amp;#39;t any help, yet she still thanked me. She did great. I was ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t criticize. Encourage instead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few months later, I&amp;#39;m still far from being perfect, but I became more hearty in my appreviation and lavish in my praise, as Dale Carnegie &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034"&gt;would say&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s all because of Elle&amp;#39;s natural talent and humble personality. I can&amp;#39;t thank her enough. We hope to design beautiful UX together in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have so much more to say, I&amp;#39;ll stop before it gets too embarrassing. In summary, I suggest using a &amp;ldquo;Thank You&amp;rdquo; note format to kickstart your blog.&lt;/p&gt;
